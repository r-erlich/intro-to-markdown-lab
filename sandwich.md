## **1. Envision the Sandwich**

Before anything else, you must **envison** envision the sandwich you wish to create. What types of meats, vegetables, and spreads do you wish to have be components of your sandwich? What type of bread shall they rest upon? Will the sandwich draw particular inspiration from a certain region or culture? All must be carefully considered before embarking on your journey in creating a sandwich.

## **2. Acquiring the Materials**

Great! You have decided on what components will make up your sandwich. Now you must actually **acquire the materials** to bring your concept into reality. Some ingredients you may already have available at your home, and some you're going to have to go to the store to purchase. You'll also have to decide if you want to make components such as the bread and spreads from scratch, or if you'll be purchasing versions that have already been made and are available for purchase.

## **3. Assembling your Sandwich**

Congratulations, you gathered all of the necessary elements in order to **assemble your sandwich!** A traditional assembly for a typical sandwich would be a piece of bread on the bottom. Then on that bread you would spread some of whatever sauce you chose. On top of that you might want to place you vegetables, followed by your meat, and then maybe some cheese you wanted on your sandwich on top of that. Now you might want to place a second piece of bread on top to complete your sandwich, or you could leave it as is to enjoy your creation as is. This is only one possibility though, as creativity is highly encouraged in the sandwich making process.

## **4. Eat your Sandwich**

It is now time for the moment of truth, it is time to **eat your sandwich!** Enjoy!
